## 📺 Our Story: Why TVMalaysia.Homes Exists

Welcome to [TVMalaysia.Homes](https://www.tvmalaysia.homes/), your online guide to watching Malaysian TV channels — anytime, anywhere.

This platform was born out of a simple need: staying connected to Malaysian television while traveling or living abroad. We realized many people struggled to access local shows from outside the country. That’s when we decided to create a helpful, user-friendly blog to guide viewers to available channels, apps, and legitimate online sources.

However, while we love sharing helpful content, there are some important points you need to know — so here's our official **disclaimer**.
